### Prerequisites

### Remarks

1) The ExternalID field of the person contains the EmployeeID (MedewerkerId) of the person. This is the Unique key.
2) The EmployeeNumber (MedewerkerNummer) is by default mapped to the "UserName" field.  This field is not unique.
3) The current value of the Manager, Costcenter, Department and Function is available. This current value is copied to the appropriate fields of each contract in helloid, but is not related to the specific contract.  (all contracts have the same "current" value for these fields)
4) Historical information is available for NMBRS-contracts, Departments, Functions, Employments and Schedules. This are stored as "contracts" in helloid, where the "contracttype" is one of "Contract, Departments, Functions, Employments and Schedules".
5) For contracts of type "contract", it has been found that there can be multiple contracts with the same Id. If this is the case, the current contract is retreived instead, so there will not be multiple contracts with the same id in the end result.
